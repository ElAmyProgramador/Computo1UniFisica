Para el curso nos pidieron instalar pytho y algunas lbrerias que usaremos (seg√∫n), entre ellas:
1. numpy, como era de esperarse en una carrera de matem√°ticas
2. scipy, aunque esto lo veo mas para 2do semestre en donde llevamos algebra lineal y mecanica vectorial, pero bueno, si se usa porque no :v
3. matplotlib, esta ya es una vieja confiable para graficar, me parece que en el plan viene tambien mathlab, surfer y seaborn, si igual lo piden pues aqui lo subire
4. vpython que al parecer sirve para hacer animaciones 2d o 3d desde el navegador con webgl
    Este en particular me daba errores porque en mi distro linux no est√° dentro de su gestor de paquetes nativo, y pip me recomienda instalar con pipx, el caso es que tiene como 34 dependencias entonces las tuve que instalar todas :v
    Dejar√© un archivo install.sh para instalarlo, despues de instalarlo y si todo sali√≥ bien entonces deber√° aparecer un mensaje como el siguiente:
